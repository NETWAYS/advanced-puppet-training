# Good Design

* Good modules should:
 * only manage their own resources.
 * be granular and portable.
 * avoid exposing implementation details.
* Good architecture should:
 * provide business logic to classification.
 * provide an abstraction layer for implementation of components.
 * make code adaptable to complex requirements.
 * reduce node-level logic.
 * reduce functionality overlap.
