# Good Design

* Good modules should:
 * Only manage their own resources
 * Be granular and portable
 * Avoid exposing implementation details
* Good architecture should:
 * Provide business logic to classification
 * Provide an abstraction layer for implementation of components
 * Make code adaptable to complex requirements
 * Reduce node-level logic
 * Reduce functionality overlap
